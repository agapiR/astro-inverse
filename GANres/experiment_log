GANres_complete_small_lr_tandem: (forgot to save training log)

- complete data (dim 223)
- latent dim = 55
- 4-layer NN
- lrG = lrD = 0.05
- iterD = 1 (train in tandem/ before we did one update step of G for every two steps of D)


GANres_complete_small_lr_tandem_no_projection:

- complete data (dim 223)
- latent dim = 55
- 4-layer NN
- lrG = lrD = 0.05
- iterD = 1 (train in tandem/ before we did one update step of G for every two steps of D)
- do not project latent codes onto unit sphere (before we did the projection)


GANres_complete_small_small_lr_tandem_no_projection:
- as above with lrG = lrD = 0.01

- all as above
- latent size = 20
- using 90% training data


GANres_training_90perc_latent30:
- all as above
- latent size = 30
- using 90% training data
